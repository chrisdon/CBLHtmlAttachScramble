Demonstration of a CouchBase Lite Document text/html attachment not being correctly displayed

The app replicates from a couchDB instance and extracts the following text/html attachment - 
http://54.75.156.177:5984/public/38efd6c0d96855be655fb3f3fa000af0/33.html - from a local Document 
and displays to screen.

The result is a mess of scrambled text.
